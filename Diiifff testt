## THEORY

### Integrator

The integrator circuit performs mathematical integration of the input signal.

The output voltage is given by:

\[
V_o = -\frac{1}{RC}\int V_i\,dt + k
\]

where:

- \(V_o\) = Output voltage
- \(V_i\) = Input voltage
- \(R\) = Resistance
- \(C\) = Capacitance
- \(k\) = Constant of integration

The peak output voltage is:

\[
V_T = \frac{V_iT}{4RC}
\]

where:

- \(T\) = Time period of the input square wave

#### Applications

- Analog computers
- Wave shaping circuits
- Signal processing systems

---

### Differentiator

A differentiator is obtained by replacing the input resistor of an inverting amplifier with a capacitor.

The output voltage is:

\[
V_o = -R_F C_i \frac{dV_i}{dt}
\]

where:

- \(R_F\) = Feedback resistance
- \(C_i\) = Input capacitance

#### Characteristics

- Acts as a High Pass Filter
- Gain increases with frequency
- Susceptible to high-frequency noise
- May become unstable at high frequencies

Additional circuit elements can be used to improve stability and reduce noise.

## DESIGN AND CIRCUIT DIAGRAMS

### Design of Integrator

Given:

- Input Frequency = 1 kHz
- Capacitance, \(C = 0.01 \mu F\)

The unity gain frequency is:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi R_1 C}
\]

Calculating:

\[
R_1 = 15.9\,k\Omega
\]

Standard value used:

- \(R_1 = 15\,k\Omega\)

Feedback resistor:

- \(R_2 = 470\,k\Omega\)

#### Purpose of \(R_2\)

- Reduces low-frequency gain
- Minimizes effects of DC offset voltage
- Typically selected as 10 times or more than \(R_1\)
